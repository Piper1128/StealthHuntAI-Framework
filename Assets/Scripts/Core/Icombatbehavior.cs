    ///   OnEnterCombat  called once when AlertState transitions to Hostile
    ///   Tick           called every frame while WantsControl is true
    ///   OnExitCombat   called once when AlertState leaves Hostile

    /// Control:
    ///   Set WantsControl = true  to take over Hostile state from Core
    ///   Set WantsControl = false to let Core run Pursuing/Shooting as fallback
    ///
    /// When WantsControl is true:
    ///   - Core skips Pursuing, Shooting, LostTarget ticks
    ///   - Core skips UpdateAnimator (Combat Pack owns animation)
    ///   - Core still owns awareness, state transitions out of Hostile,
    ///     squad intel, and perception -- Combat Pack does not touch these
    ///
